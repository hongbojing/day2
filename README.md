# day2
Hello world!!!! how r yaaaaaaa!

Today is still the "day1", but I just came up with a good idea for day2 so I create the new repo for it.
As I mentioned in day1, I would write blogs to record the process of creating these 365 pages, unfortunately, I do not have any blogs, so I decide to write a simple one myself, you see, as a web developer, you could create these tools yourself and have complete control of it.

I would like to use a good-looking style which is perfect to read, so that's it, the day2 project:
